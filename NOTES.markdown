Editor's Note:

Dear Mark (no point in pretending anonymity in this case)


           Many thanks for this paper which builds on the argument of your previous one. I’m very happy to accept it in principle for publication, but, in addition to the typos there are a few points where further clarification of your argument would help (see comments below). I’m also attaching the comments from the referees, though I don’t agree with the suggestion of referee 2 that you should omit all the Shoemaker quotations. Indeed I’m not bothered by the Kalderon vs. Shoemaker format of much of the paper, though it would be better if you emphasised at the start that this is primarily an expository strategy you are adopting to facilitate the presentation and defence of your core position, the inheritance thesis as revised to take account of the ‘multiple aspect’ account of the qualitative character of colours (pp. 35-6). Indeed it would be no bad thing to spell this out a bit more explicitly at the of the paper, so that it is clear how you are revising the position set up for discussion in section 2.


Comments


p. 3 Might it be worth briefly setting aside one obvious, but (I take it) irrelevant, counterexample to the thesis presented here? – The presence in experience of exactly similar objects (e.g. red billiard balls) generally does not bring with a difference in the phenomenal character of experience.


pp. 3- 4. Perceptual presentation: as against Price you affirm that qualities of the material environment can be present in perceptual experience. Fine – but then I was surprised to find on pp. 30-2 you discuss a conception of phenomenal experience as a conscious modification of the subject in a way which suggests that this position is consistent with the position you take on p. 4. Maybe it is consistent, though the alternative you go on to affirm, in terms of a ‘perspective … on the chromatic features of the material environment’, looks to be just an application of the position affirmed on p. 4. The issue here, let me stress, is no objection to your position; it’s just a matter of clarity of exposition. It looks as though on pp. 30-1 you bring back into consideration a position which you rejected on pp. 3-4. There’s no reason at all why you should not do this; but it’s helpful to the reader if you clarify what’s going on.


p. 5 How does the thesis on the top of this page accommodate after-images? Are they ‘objects … present in experience’? Maybe they are ; but it would be helpful to say a little more to show how this thesis accommodates these and similar familiar phenomena.


p. 6 line 7 ‘covary’ ?


p. 10 line 1 ‘For example, <it> is not …’?


pp. 13-4 In your reconstruction of Shoemaker’s argument can you elucidate one or two of his key phrases: (i) ‘color quality space’ – is this what you call ‘colour property space’. I take it that this is intended, but it would be useful to make this explicit; (ii) ‘surface color realizers’ and ‘reflectances’ – are these what you call ‘colour experience’ and thus what is represented within what you call ‘colour experience space’? I’m not sure – but then I’m not quite sure how your discussion, with its distinction between colour property space and colour experience space fits onto Shoemaker’s argument.


p. 15 lines 2-3 Instead of ‘a distinct color property space to’ can we have ‘a colour property space distinct from’?

           line 7 Not ‘different for’ but ‘different from’


p. 16 Section 5 The way you start this section, it is implicated that the passage you cite from Shoemaker might provide a way of defending the inheritance thesis. And this is indeed the suggestion that is in effect proposed on pp. 22 (top). But none of this is manifest on pp. 16-7, and at the moment the reader is puzzled: the relevance of the Shoemaker passage to the inheritance thesis isn’t obvious. So it would be good to help out the reader a bit here.


p. 22 lines 6-5up I don’t have Shoemaker’s paper to hand but it reads very oddly. Instead of ‘so their experience of it … are’ shouldn’t it be ‘so that their experiences of it … are’?


p. 23 line 4 Not ‘cause’ but ‘causes’ ?


p. 26 bottom line: not ‘and’ but ‘an’

Report from Referee 2:

This is an interesting paper that contains some genuinely novel moves,
and that will move the debate forward. However, I believe there are a
number of problems with the paper that make it not quite ready for
publication. So I think the right verdict is to reject with
encouragement to resubmit. Below I list a number of points, of varying
levels of importance, that I would encourage the author to consider in
revising the paper.

1. Somewhat oddly, the paper reads almost as a personal debate with
Shoemaker; it progresses through a long series of back and forth moves
before we get to the original contribution of the paper in section
7. In my view the paper would be much easier to digest (and more
interesting to readers other than Shoemaker!) if the early
material in sections 1-6 could be considerably compressed, and pitched
more widely rather than, specifically, as a stage in a long exchange
with Shoemaker. (Here's one suggestion toward this end. In many of the
stages of the exchange the author gives long quotations of Shoemaker's
arguments, and then goes on and reformulates those arguments in his or
her own words. Since the arguments are being reformulated anyway, why
not just drop many or all of the quotations?)

2. In pp5-7 the author insists that inheritance entails not only
interworld covariation of experience's phenomenal properties and
something present in experience, but that the former holds "because
of" the latter. I'm unclear just what the extra requirement (above and
beyond interworld covariation) amounts to. The author uses "because
of" and "explanatory" interchangeably, but it's not obvious they come
to the same thing. The gloss on p5 ("an experience has the relevant
phenomenal property *because* of what is present in experience")
certainly suggests that the author wants the relation of inheritance
to be asymmetric (which is plausible enough), but that doesn't say
enough. For example, would (asymmetric) one-way supervenience count as
inheritance? The author suggests it would not on p7 in criticizing
Byrne's supervenience formulation of representationalism; but it's not
clear why given what he has said is needed for inheritance. Most
importantly, though the author can stipulate anything he or she wants,
readers need to see motivation for building in the extra requirement
(which is not now present in the paper) since it forms the core of the
author's response to Shoemaker in section 7.

3.  On p19: "Color constancy is the capacity of color to appear to
persist, unaltered, through changes in its appearance across a broad
range of scenes and conditions of illumination."
I don't understand how a color could appear to persist, unaltered,
through changes in its appearance. Why wouldn't a hypothesized change
in its appearance -- even granting, concessively to the author, that
this is understood as a manifestation of a novel qualitative aspect of
the nature of the one color --- constitute a respect in which the one
color would appear to be altered?

4. Author develops the Shoemaker worry in section 6 in a way that boils
down to the question whether qualitative experiences in Norm and Norma
can be different despite identity of proximate causal effects of c on
Norm's and Norma's visual systems. This question has also been pressed
against selectionism in Pautz, "Sensory Awareness Is not a Wide
Physical Relation: An Empirical Argument Against Externalist
Intentionalism," Nous 400(2): 205-240, 2006. It would be worth
mentioning that paper as part of a more general effort to generalize
the discussion past the particular concerns of Shoemaker.

5. Although this is not his main response to the problem raised in
section 6, the author initially makes the move of claiming that in
actual cases of qualitative difference, there is a difference in
proximate retinal/receptoral effects. Although this is a bit hard to
assess as stated, it strikes me as implausible. We should allow that
Ss with numerically distinct retinae, with different cone population
ratios, etc can count as having the same "pattern of retinal effects,"
lest there be vanishingly few cases of identity of proximal effects in
two different subjects. Supposing, then, that you and I can count as
undergoing the same proximal effect if some of your L cones fire and
come of my L cones fire as a result of absorbing light from x, then I
don't see any reason that the post-receptoral channels that your
L-cones and my L-cones have to be the same as mine. But since exactly
these kinds of post-receptoral channels form the heart of the standard
explanations of a number of qualitative aspects of phenomenal color
experience (eg, the unique/binary distinction, opponency, color
similarity), it appears to be entirely possible (and in fact plausibly
actual) for there to be an interpersonal difference in qualitative
experience despite identity of proximate patterns of retinal effects
of the stimulus (given any acceptable, ie not vacuously narrow,
individuation of such patterns).

6. The author's main response to the problematic cases (which I take
to be the most important and novel contribution of the paper), though,
comes out in section 7. There the idea is that we should think of the
proximate effects of exposure to color c not as a pattern of retinal
effects, but as the standing of the subject in a relation to c's
instantiation from which one aspect of c's qualitative nature is
revealed. So conceived, the proximate effects of c on Norm and Norma
differ, as needed. Nice idea. But why is the new way of thinking of
proximate effects mandatory? Because the "alternative relational
conception of experience is the natural setting for the inheritance
thesis" (34)? I guess I don't see why that is so. It sure seems like a
perfectly good notion of proximate effects (/subset of the causal
powers of c to be identified with c's qualitative nature) is c's
pattern of retinal effects, which author effectively admits by saying
that these two explanations can live side by side (35). As far as I
can see the author needs to install his or her own preferred choice of
c's causal effects as that identical to c's qualitative nature in
order to make this solution work, but I don't see any good argument
for this choice, which (of course) depends on a highly controversial
way of thinking about perceptual experience.

7. I am bothered by a version of the worry addressed on the bottom of
p35 through p36 -- the worry to the effect that we are only getting an
etiolated version of chromatic inheritance that is not worth
having. Concede, with the author, that Norm's and Norma's experiences
differ in phenomenal character by virtue of those experiences
presenting different of the multiple qualitative aspects of c. I am
prepared to grant that this counts as inheritance (in one important
sense) of the qualitative nature of the experience from the (multiple)
qualitative nature of c. Still, I have the nagging feeling that this
is not all that fans of inheritance wanted it to do. For example,
Norm's qualitative experience doesn't inherit all of the aspects of
c's nature (it is partial), and what makes it the case that Norm's
experience inherits one aspect rather than another is not c but some
relational/access/enabling features of Norm and the perceptual
conditions. Consequently there's an explanatory gap left between the
qualitative nature of c on the one hand and Norm's qualitative
experience of c on the other. In view of this explanatory gap it can
seem a substantial stretch to say that inheritance has been saved qua
specifically explanatory thesis.

8. Connected with the last point, it might be useful to compare the
resulting picture with the views of Brad Thompson (centrally "Senses
for Senses", but perhaps some of his other papers as well, and maybe
some of the stuff Thompson cites from Chalmers). The comparison would
be interesting because the present paper and Thompson's view have a
lot of the same apparatus (eg, multiple qualitative aspects of one
color c vs perceptual modes of presentation of one color c) although
Thompson would deny many of the assumptions motivating the
present paper. Eg, and significantly, Thompson takes his structurally
similar account to be a repudiation of chromatic inheritance, whereas
the present paper is supposed to be a vindication of chromatic
inheritance.

-----------------------end referee report


Report from Referee 3:

The paper is a defense of a Hilbert and Kalderon’s “selectionist” account of color perception in response to objections by Shoemaker. It is argued that color experiences “inherit” their phenomenal character from the qualitative character of the perceived color, because colors are “multiply qualitative”: the same color has different qualitative aspects, that are perceptually available to different perceivers (and to the same perceiver in different situations). Presentations of the same color can therefore differ in their phenomenal character, and presentations of different colors can share their phenomenal character.



The paper is clear, well argued and interesting. If I have a general concern about the paper, it is that the focus on Shoemaker’s objections to Hilbert and Kalderon’s selectionism might limit the paper’s general appeal (neither paper was published in Mind).



pp. 3-7 It might help a more general reader if the notion of “inheritance” could be compared/contrasted with the more commonly discussed notion of “transparency”.



pp. 7-11 It might also help if “selectionism” is compared/contrasted with relationalism at this point in the paper (It is discussed later, pp. 25-6).



A specific thought about this section: it does not obviously follow from the claim that “Objects, qualities, and relations of the material environment can be present in a subject’s perceptual experience of that environment” (p. 4) that these qualities are mind-independent (as appears in the statement of the assumption immediately below on p. 4). By comparison, things in the material environment can appear funny, but being funny is not normally thought of as a mind-independent quality. This does not affect the main argument of the paper, but is relevant to the motivation of the view defended, as this kind of consideration might make a relational view of color seem more attractive from the outset.



p. 17 It wasn’t clear what the problem was supposed to be with the view that subjects who differ in the spectral location of the unique hues see the same determinate shade as determinates of different determinables. A brief indication of the general shape of problem might be helpful.



pp. 18-9 The author seems to suggest that cases of color blindness are not “veridical” cases of perceptual variation. The idea seems to be that it is possible for deuteranomolous perceivers to “come to see” eg. a green thing as green. As I understand it, this depends in part on the size of the stimulus (see the last line of the quotation from Broackes). When stimuli are indistinguishable for a color blind subject (eg. because they are smaller), why doesn’t the selectionist have to say that the color blind subject is selecting different qualitative aspects of the colors, in virtue of differences in their visual system? Can the selectionist really allow that this is a case of misperception (even if we grant that “deficient” might not be quite the right word to describe deuteranomolous subjects, as the author notes, p. 18)? The worry in the background is that the selectionist view threatens to over-generalize, and so might appear to be objectionable on independent grounds.



pp. 19-20 The comparison with color constancy is a helpful way of making vivid the idea that colors might be multiply qualitative, but a potential difference is that our experience of colors under different lights is sometimes thought of as “two-dimensional”: we see both qualitative sameness and qualitative difference (e.g. Noë, Action in Perception). There is nothing comparable in the interpersonal case, so even if we accept the multiply qualitative character of color in the intrapersonal case, the extension of the idea might seem to require further justification. (After all, we don’t perceive colors to have qualitative characters that other subjects can see.)



pp. 28-37 The underlying problem with Shoemaker’s objection is traced to what is described as an “optional conception of perceptual experience”, as a way of being affected. Instead, it is suggested that we should think of color experience as relational. This discussion is interesting, but I was unsure about a couple of points.



1) I was not clear what Shoemaker’s distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic causal powers was, or precisely what role it played in Shoemaker’s argument. Shoemaker mentions as an example of an extrinsic power Boyle’s example of a key’s power to open a door. But isn’t there a sense in which if any causal powers are external, all are? Eg. in the same sense that the key loses the power to open the door if the lock is changed, doesn’t the object lose the power to produce experiences in the dark?

2) The author describes Shoemaker as believing that phenomenal experience is a way of being affected (p. 31). I wasn’t sure that this fits with the role of “appearance properties” in his account, which (if I understand it) are supposed to be represented in the content of experience—hence Shoemaker’s view is a version of representationalism, just with a non-standard view of the contents of experience.

3) Following on from the last point, views of phenomenal experience as “a way of being affected” are associated with adverbialist and qualia theories. They are contrasted with relation theories, e.g. Campbell, Kalderon, Martin. Where do (standard) representationalist views fit into this? Are representational states also conscious modifications?



A general worry with the overall line of argument in the paper is whether there will be any constraints on the number of qualitative aspects that colors can have. If colors have too many qualitative aspects, then the selectionist explanation of color experience may begin to sound trivial. We will just add an extra qualitative aspect for each hypothetical subject who selects the same color as part of a different property space. The author claims that cases in which two subjects select the same color to feature in distinct property spaces “are improbable, but seem at least logically possible given selectionism” (p. 12). But why is this only improbable?

# NOUS review

Reviewer: 1
Comments to the Author
Report on 'The Multiply Qualitative' 
This is a professional paper on an important issue that argues a reasonably plausible case (though I have reservations I shall mention below). I'm sorry to say, though, that in general I found the paper relatively light on important new material: it gives a good exposition of Shoemaker's 2003 & 2006 worries, and of some views that are elsewhere argued more fully by Kalderon and others, but the main new arguments of the paper really only get going in the middle of § 6 -- and I'm sorry to say I didn't feel the strength of argument and depth of investigation in what followed were really sufficient for publication in a top journal.

The paper argues, in general, that the claims (1) 'that the qualitative character of color experience is inherited from the qualitative character of the experienced color' and (2) 'that there are faultless forms of variation in color perception' are in fact (despite Shoemaker's worries) compatible. The key to the solution (in Sect. 7) is supposed to lie in substituting an improved conception of experience for the old conception of it as a 'conscious modification of a subject'.


Main questions

The main proposal of the paper builds on rejecting the conception of an experience of a color as a 'conscious modification of a subject', and conceiving of it instead as a matter of the perceiver's coming to 'stand in a relation to that color's instantiation' (17-18). If one and the same color c produces experiences with different qualitative content in (say) Norm and Norma, then (given this improved conception of experience) we can say that the 'proximate effects on Norm and Norma themselves differ'--which means that 'distinct causal features of the color are involved in Norm and Norma's perception' and, in turn, that 'a qualitative aspect of the color must be an intrinsic causal power.' (p. 18)
    The idea, I think, is that we may say that one color c produces two different experiences e1 and e2 (in Norm and Norma); but this is not a proof (as Shoemaker thinks) that c fails to determine the qualitative character of e1 and e2, but instead a sign that it is different intrinsic powers of c that are at work in the two cases. The 'proximate effect' of the color on the perceiver is the experience, not the retinal stimulation--so it is simply not true that c produces the same 'proximate effect' on the two perceivers: it produces different ones.
       I think this is an interesting suggestion, but it does invite a much fuller investigation. What if an objector were to say, 'OK, c produces different experiences e1 and e2 (we all agree this anyway: given either the new conception of experience or the old one). But what gives you the right to say that it is distinct intrinsic causal features of the color that are at work in the two cases? Isn't there a clear sense in which we want to say (indeed, did say, in setting up the example) that the experiences are different in Norm and in Norma because their visual systems are different? You want to say that their experiences differ because they are being presented with 'different aspects' of the same color--as if that meant there was no need also to mention the difference in the visual systems (something extrinsic to the color) in giving an explanation of the resulting difference between e1 and e2.  But what determines which aspects of a color are perceived? Answer (for the kinds of case we're considering): surely the nature of the visual system of the perceivers ... So I don't see that you can effectively argue that the proper explanation of the variation in experience is simply a variation intrinsic to the color.' (This is an extension of the kind of concern in Shoemaker's earlier objection about the 'Pickwickean sense' in an earlier round of argument. It is not meant as a knock-down objection--but I do wish the discussion had been taken further.)  --I'd love to see some more discussion of what an 'intrinsic property' in this context is (is it something that one thing could have if it were the one thing in existence, or what?). --And, above all, I wondered where this really leaves the notion of 'qualitative character'. I can imagine a person saying, 'OK, the experiences (in your new sense) of Norm and Norma differ thanks to the different aspects of the color being perceived; similarly the (individualistically conceived) qualitative character of their perceptions also differ. Now (i) The qualitative character therefore is "inherited" from or determined by not the color, but the "aspect of color" perceived (or by the 'intrinsic causal power' underlying the presentation of that aspect). So surely this is not a defense of Campbell's view in the way he intended it. (And actually it really doesn't look like a way of allowing (1) to be true either.) (And it would certainly be good to have some more investigation of what "inheritance" comes to and what motivates inheritance claims in this domain.) More importantly, (ii) couldn't a person who liked individualistically conceived qualitative character actually translate the core of your proposal into her own language, and say that different aspects of the color (or different 'intrinsic causal powers') cause the different experiences in Norm and Norma? So does your new conception of experience really do a lot of work here?' (I can see the beginnings of a response on this; but in any case, it would be good to have some explicit discussion.)


Smaller Points
p. 1 '... there is a way it is like for Norm to undergo that experience.' --Does that really make sense? Or should it be rephrased as, e.g., 'there is something it is like ... '?

There are lots of cases where a plural verb has singular subject (or vice versa):
e.g. 'reflection on the problems ... reveal ...' (p. 2), 'a difference in the phenomenal properties ... suffice ...' (p. 3), etc. etc.

p. 7 contrasts the case where properties f and g have extensions that 'overlap' with the case where they 'necessarily coincide'. -- (i) I suspect that the distinction intended is simply that between cases of contingent coextensiveness and cases of necessary coextensiveness. But then the use of the phrases 'overlap' and 'necessarily coincide' is confusing -- because it seems to leave open the possibility also of cases of 'contingent coincidence' -- which I think (in the author's intended usage) is actually not meant to be coherent at all. (He wants 'necessary coincidence' to be trivially equivalent to 'coincidence'.)  (ii) I suspect 'overlap' is not at all a good term for a case of coextensiveness at all. At least in some normal usages, we say the tablecloth 'overlaps' the table when it is larger than the table: there is some 'overlap' (some extra portion that extends beyond the table). So such a term is not ideal for expressing exactly the opposite -- the case precisely of no overlap. Meanwhile, (3) the phrase 'coincides with' is of course often used, in ordinary and philosophical language, for cases of a coincidence -- in the sense, an accidental conjunction of phenomena -- which is precisely the opposite of what the author wants.
   Of course I know that usage varies, but ... (if (3) was not thought too pressing a problem) why not just talk of the extensions either 'contingently coinciding' or 'necessarily coinciding'?  And even better, why not talk, more simply, of contingent and necessary coextensiveness?

p. 8 different for SHOULD READ different from

p. 14 realtivism SHOULD READ relativism
and important range SHOULD READ an important range
p. 18 'To suppose otherwise would be a kind of level confusion.' I'm puzzled: The sentence seems (if I've not completely missed the drift of the argument) to say exactly the opposite of what was intended.

The argument at the end of §6 strikes me as pretty weak. Shoemaker envisages a case where two people faced with one color undergo the same 'proximate effects' (e.g. in the retina) but this 'input' is 'processed in different ways' further along in their two visual systems (thus supposedly refuting the idea that the characteristics of the experiences can be 'inherited' from the color itself). In the response at this stage, the author replies that 'in many such cases' there will actually be 'different patterns of retinal stimulation'. I am puzzled: this sounds like simply contradicting the case description envisaged by Shoemaker--for a case of 'different patterns' of retinal stimulation surely won't be a case of same 'proximate effects' of the kind Shoemaker is envisaging. (Or does the author have in mind a sameness of 'proximate effects' even earlier or 'further back' than the retina?--if so, he could give a fuller explanation.) Or perhaps the author is just substituting a different kind of case, since he doesn't believe Shoemaker's case is really possible. But he doesn't in fact defend that view; and the author himself seems to withdraw the objection on the next page. ('The worry ... is too weak ...') So I was puzzled about what exactly was being argued.

# Mind and Language Review

Page 1, para. 1. The choice to anchor color in the properties of
surfaces ("red tomato") is problematic. What experimental subjects
report about the perceived color of a surface depends not only on the
spectral reflecting properties of the surface but also on the
spectrum of the illuminant and the spectral reflectance and spatial
disposition of other surfaces in the field of view. Moreover, what
they report depends critically on what color properties they are
asked to consider (Foster, 2003).

Page 7, para. 2. That the families of properties are distinct may not
be correct. More plausibly, by analogy with the visual behavior of
dichromats and trichromats, the vision of one may be a subset of the
other: a dichromat accepts all the color matches made by a trichromat
(Wyszecki & Stiles, 1982).

Page 10, para. 3. Deuteranomaly does not produce "a reduction in
sensitivity to [the] green portion of the spectrum", at least not a
diagnostically useful one. The spectral sensitivity of deuteranopes
is almost normal (Wright, 1946).

Page 10, para. 3. The Ishihara test is not the most appropriate here.
The standard is the Rayleigh anomaloscope. Either use this or simply
refer to a color-vision test.

Page 10, para. 3. The statement "In certain circumstances of
perception, Norm is prone to take a green thing to be red" is an
exaggeration. Deuteranomalous trichromats and normal trichromats
differ in their matches of a monochromatic yellow light against a
mixture of monochromatic red and green lights, with deuteranomalous
trichromats requiring more green light, but this does not imply that
they take a green thing to be red.

Page 10, para. -1. The statement "It is plausible, then, that Norm
sees the same determinate shade of green as Norma. It is just that
their visual systems apply different color categories to this shade"
is unlikely to be true, in that there is no experimental evidence
that these two groups of observers actually differ in their naming
behavior with printed colors (Cole, Lian, Sharpe & Lakkis, 2006) or
differ in their ability to match surface colors in natural scenes
(Baraas, Foster, Amano & Nascimento, 2006).

Page 11, para. -2, lines 1-2. The use here in an apparently objective
sense of "identical color" is, as elsewhere, ambiguous. Is "color"
meant to stand for surface color (a physical correlate of spectral
reflectance), or for the spectrum of the reflected light (contingent
on the illuminant spectrum), or for some pattern of photoreceptor
activity in the eye?

Page 15, para. 1. The statement "Not only will a difference in the
peak sensitivities of the cones result in variation in color vision,
but so will varying the shape of the sensitivity curves", while being
true as a piece of argument, has an implausible premise:
spectral-sensitivity curves have a constant shape on a frequency
scale (MacNichol, 1986).

Page 15, para. 1. The statement "And the intersubjective variation in
the spectral location of the unique hues is similarly due to a
difference in the retinal effect of the visual stimulus" is almost
certainly untrue (Webster, Miyahara, Malkoc & Raker, 2000).

# Shoemaker Correspondence

I have read through your paper “The Multiply Qualitative.”  It is a very rich and interesting paper.  But it is quite complex, and I didn’t fully understand everything in it.  Here are some comments.

Since you ascribe to me the view that makes phenomenal characters of experiences representations of  “appearance properties,” I should point out that in my 2006 I abandon the account in terms of appearance properties in favor of one in terms of “aspects” of colors, the idea being that a case of spectrum inversion will be one in which the same color presents different aspects to perceivers of different kinds, and in which the aspect of a color presented to one sort of perceiver by one color can be the same as that presented by a different color to a different sort of perceiver.  That is a version of the view that, as you put it, “colors have multiple qualitative natures,” and on p. 30 you mention that I am (in my 2006) sympathetic with that view.  I’ll comment in a bit on your response to my criticism of the claim that this view can be reconciled with the inheritance thesis.

But first let me say that I was left unclear where you come down on the issue of spectrum inversion.  You seem to accept the view that colors have multiple qualitative characters, and you describe how this might be used to explain the possibility of spectrum inversion.  But unless I missed something, you never argue that such an explanation has to fail.  That is, unless I missed something you allow that spectrum inversion, so understood, is possible.  You seem content to argue that the view that colors have multiple qualitative characters is compatible with the inheritance thesis.

With regard to that, and  your response to my argument quoted on pp. 30-31, I agree that in actual cases the proximate effects of a color on different kinds of perceptual systems are not the same.  You rightly anticipate my response, namely that all I need to claim is that there are possible cases where the proximate effects are the same.  But I didn’t understand your response to this, on p. 33.   I don’t understand how the distinction between clearly conceiving and distinctly conceiving (which in any case I have a dim understanding of) is supposed to apply here.  If we can conceive of a pair of mechanisms that respond differently to the light coming from objects with a given color, surely we can conceive of these mechanisms receiving their input from a mechanism that doesn’t respond differently (like a lens, or a system of mirrors).  

Turning to what I take to be a central claim of the paper, I didn’t understand how the “partiality” of perception, as described (e.g.) by Broackes, is suppose to give the qualitative character of color experience positive epistemological significance only on views, like standard representationalism, that accept the inheritance thesis, and not on the view that color experience is “merely a causal intermediary,” and not on the appearance property view.   Proponents of the latter views can hold that, for a given sort of perceiver, a given color is associated with a cluster of qualitative characters, or a cluster of appearance properties, such that different members of the cluster are produced, or manifested, under different conditions – and that for a person to know what color he is perceiving he must have some idea of what members of these clusters would be produced by the objects under the different conditions.  It is just that the association of the colors with such clusters is contingent, and that the clusters associated with a color will be different for perceivers with different sorts of perceptual system.  I take it that on the view you favor the association with the clusters is necessary.  What is unclear to me is why this makes a difference with respect to positive epistemological significance.  (And if we broaden the partiality of perception to encompass the view that colors have multiple qualitative characters in a way that allows for spectrum inversion or shifted spectra, surely it could not make a difference).  I thought that the appeal on p. 7 to the possibility of philosophical zombies was a red herring.  A sensible view of qualia will deny that possibility.  

I was unmoved by your response to Chalmers’ argument from arbitrariness on p. 18ff.  I haven’t read Byrne and Hilbert 2006, but the argument that seems implicit in the quote from them seems bad.  How can it matter whether the apple is red or green?  By hypothesis the apple looks red to Norm iff it looks red to Norma, despite the difference in the qualitative character of their experiences.  And the argument from arbitrariness won’t of course claim that neither is misperceiving if there is a relevant difference of the sort you describe (Norma’s color perception having – if I understand you – a nonstandard cause).   It seems to me that the motivation for the argument from arbitariness is similar to that for your claim on p. 22 that it is implausible to suppose that trichromats perceive the true colors of things while tetrachromats are subject to systematic color illusion.  

On p. 14, near the bottom, you have a one sentence paragraph reading “What properties might these be?”  The reference of “these” is far from apparent, though one can figure it out.

The last full para. on p. 23 seemed to me overcompressed and initially unclear.

I found the discussion of representationalism on pp. 34-35 hard to take in.  When at the bottom you begin a paragraph by saying “Standard representationalism in contrast,” I wasn’t clear whether the contrast was with Fregean accounts of perceptual content in general, or only with nondescriptive Fregean accounts.   And I was puzzled by the question you pose in the middle of p. 35, where you have Norm perceiving an object to be red and Norma perceiving it to be green.  That is not the inverted spectrum scenario, where what color they represent the object as having is supposed to be the same.  And if we are going here with the multiple qualitative characters view, their experiences are representing different aspects of the color, and both can be right.  But I suspect that I am missing the point of this paragraph.  
  
Best,
Sydney

Dear Mark,

Thanks for your message.

If I understand you, you think that we can have your (1)  two subjects whose perceptions are phenomenally inverted  but question whether we can have your (2)  that their perceptions would share the same content.  But suppose we have (1) in virtue of a single color presenting different aspects to our two subjects.  There will be a difference in the content of the experiences insofar as they represent different aspects of the color.  But there will also be sameness of content, insofar as they represent the same color.  That seems to me to give us (2) in the sense required for spectrum inversion.

With regard to footnote 8 of “On the way…,” you express puzzlement about what phenomenal properties are if the case described there is possible.  You say that they “cannot merely be presentations of qualitative aspects.”  That assumes that different aspects have to be grounded in different causal features of the color.  But one needn’t hold this in order to hold that the qualitative aspects are powers of the colors  for one can hold that they are extrinsic (relational) powers.   A color’s having a certain qualitative aspect will consist in its being such as to produce experiences having a certain phenomenal property in observers of a certain sort.  That will be true even if the imagined case is not possible, and different qualitative aspects are grounded in different causal features of the colors, but it will also be true if the imagined case is possible. If you think of this as a definition of qualitative aspect in terms of phenomenal character (making the notion of phenomenal character prior), it seems incompatible with an account which defines phenomenal character in terms of the representing of qualitative aspects (making the notion of qualitative aspect prior).  But I reject both definiitions, favoring instead a “package deal” account which simultaneously defines phenomenal character and qualitative aspect in terms of their relations to one another and to other things, and gives priority to neither.   I should add that I am an internalist about phenomenal character.  That might seem to give priority to it, but I don’t think it does.   The full story would bring in the idea that the relations of phenomenal similarity and difference amongst experiences are functionally definable, that what it is to be a quale, or phenomenal property, is to be explained in terms of these relations, and that it is central to the functional account of these similarity and difference relations that the holding of these relations give rise to beliefs about similarities and differences in the world, and thus that the experiences they relate have representational content.

That is probably too brief to be intelligible.  I can understand why you were puzzled.

All the best,
Sydney

Dear Sydney,

Sorry to take so long to thank you for your comments, they were very
useful. The paper is too long, and I have decided to split it in two.

I was puzzled by one thing though. (This isn't really a request for
you to respond further---more of a brain dump.) You wrote:

thesis.

Maybe I am dim, or maybe there is a substantive issue between us
(perhaps a combination of both), but I don't understand this. First a
clarification. I don't like talk of spectrum inversion simpliciter
since, as Dave and I emphasized in our paper, there are really two
thoughts here that require separate justifications:

1. That there could be two subjects whose perceptions are
phenomenally inverted
2. That their perceptions would share the same content.

Notice that talk of veridical perceptual variation, just by itself,
doesn't get you spectrum inversion, so understood---perhaps the
subjects are selectively perceiving different features of their
environment in which case the difference in phenomenology would go
with a difference in content. (That's the thought I was trying to
vindicate.) And in the case of colors with multiply qualitative
characters, if two subjects perceiving the same color differ in
phenomenology because different qualitative aspects of the color are
presented to each, there is a difference in content and so the second
condition for spectrum inversion fails.

On a related issue, I am also a bit puzzled about footnote eight of
*On the Ways Things Appear*. I understand the point about the
Pickwickian sense of inheritance, but that left me puzzled about two
things. First, I was unsure how you were thinking about phenomenal
properties---they can't merely be presentations of qualitative
aspects (as they would be in the non-Pickwickian sense of
inheritance), so what are they? Second, unless you are thinking of
colors as Lockean secondary qualities, I was unsure how the
qualitative character of the colors could both be powers to produce
certain phenomenal experiences in perceivers and be intrinsic and
essential properties of the colors.

Thanks again for the extensive comments. That was very kind of you.

Hope you are well.

All the best, Mark

# Hilbert Correspondence

Mark,

I can't remember if I thanked you properly after the London trip but it was fun and productive. I've written a paper based on the talk I gave at the conference which will be published in Philosophical Topics.  I've attached a copy. I just returned from a trip east where, among other things, I spent some time with Alex talking about color blindness. We owe a paper to a festchrift for Larry Hardin and the plan is to produce a discussion of what the color experience of dichromats is like.  As you know I've been thinking about this issue for some time without managing to reach any very satisfactory conclusion.  I think I now have a better understanding of some of the difficult issues and I also think there is some relevance to the problem you are concerned with. 

First, a minor and largely irrelevant quibble.  I don't like the example.[^fn1] The perceived color of bodies of water is heavily influenced by the reflection of the sky from the surface of the water.  In an actual case, the water would likely look different to the two because variability in cloud cover leading to differences in the light reflected from the sky to their respective viewing positions.  My own view is that the perceived color of bodies of water is rarely veridical because of this effect. (According to me water is actually a very faint blue in color, a color which is only seen in fairly unusual circumstances, like when viewing large quantities of ice. None of this matters to your problem since it is easy enough to construct cases in which Edgar and Bernice disagree because of some difference in their visual systems.  This kind of case is the one that comes up in thinking about the color blind.  As you know, Alex and I maintain that for normal perceivers, it can't be the case that both perceptions are veridical since, according to us, their contents are incompatible.  I'll ignore that idiosyncrasy in what follows.  As you will see, issues about the constitution relation are, I think, unavoidable. 

The best solution, I think, is to take the first horn of the dilemma.  Edgar and Bernice veridically perceive distinct colors.  It will be easiest for me to explain this in terms of reflectance physicalism and then I will comment on what I don't understand in  attempting to translate it into your terms.  Edgar sees the object as possessing a (determinate) reflectance that is of type R1.  Bernice sees it as possessing a reflectance that is of type R2.  In order for both perceptions to be veridical R1 and R2 cannot be disjoint, i.e. some reflectances are of both types. In order for them to be different some reflectances must be of one type but not the other. But this is perfectly possible.[^fn2] It might be that R1 and R2 overlap without either wholly containing the other.  This kind of case is probably the one you have in mind.  It might be that everything that is of type R1 is of type R2, or vice versa (but not both).  This is the kind of case that arises in thinking about color blindness.  None of this directly addresses your worry since nothing has yet been said about causation.  The causal relations are as follows.  The determinate reflectance is causally responsible for both Edgar's perception of the object as grey and Bernice's perception of the object as green.  The objects having a reflectance of type R1 causes Edgars perception of grey and the object's having a reflectance of type R2 causes Bernice's perception of green.  The worry you express in the first horn of the dilemma doesn't arise since the only common causal factor is the determinate reflectance which is not a visible color.  The worry you raise is avoided because there are multiple "light-dispositional" properties in play. As far as I can see there is nothing here that is incompatible with the basic idea of selectionism.  This is the kind of thing I had in mind when I said that partiality helps.  Edgar and Bernice are, in effect, perceiving different aspects of the determinate reflectance.  If I've missed something here let me know. 

Here are the problems I see with this attempt to defuse your dilemma.  First, it makes the description of the original example slightly misleading.  The description of Edgar as seeing it as grey and Bernice as seeing it as green suggests that Bernice might have seen it as having the very same color as Edgar sees it as having and vice versa.  This suggestion is contradicted by my analysis.  Making some other plausible assumptions, Bernice never sees anything as having R1 and Bernice never sees anything as having R2.  I don't see this as a big problem but it would be nice to work out some way in which there is some similarity in their experience when they are both seeing something as greenish that is compatible with their visually determinate color categories being different.  Alex and I have things to say about this problem in the case of the color blind but what we have to say relies on the relation between the types being one of inclusion which doesn't apply here. 

You mention causal exclusion and this can raise another worry.  Someone might worry that the fact that the determinate reflectance causally explains the experience excludes the reflectance type from also causally explaining the experience.  I take it that the determinate reflectance does not constitute the visible color (is that right?) so that reason for ruling out the exclusion does not apply.  I think your selectionist account already faced this problem so it's not specific to the particular case under discussion.  Here is where I'm not entirely clear what the exact relation is between your light-dispositional properties and the relation of constitution and my reflectance types and the relation of identity.  Assuming that reflectance types are light-dispositional properties (there may be other l-d properties) then there are many light-dispositional properties possessed by any given object.  If the determinate light-dispositional properties are not the constituting properties then the possibility of causal exclusion of the colors (and their contituting properties) would seem to arise. If the determinate light-dispositional properties are the constituting properties then the visible colors are multiply constituted, i.e. a number of different light-dispositional properties constitute the same color.  Here's one place where my grasp of the notion of constitution is weak.  Does it make sense to talk of a property being multiply constituted?  If a property can be multiply constituted, then your claim that a constituting property can't causally exclude the constituted property seems less plausible.  After all the different constituters differ in their causal powers so their must be differences between the causal powers of the constituters and the property they collectively constitute.  (If this last bit is gibberish feel free to ignore it.)  So the problem of causal exclusion already faces your account.  My own view is that determinates do not automatically causally exclude the determinables under which they fall.  (In fact I sometimes seriously consider the more radical view that the determinable can causally explain and it's the determinate that lacks causal relevance.) 

I've gone on long enough.  Let me know if there's anything helpful in the above mess or let me know where I've gone wrong.

--Dave

Dear Dave,

It was great seeing you in London as well. We hope to see you pass through more often.

Thanks for the paper. I will definitely be reading it soon.

Thanks as well, for your generous response. I agree with most of it. I too had problems with Mark's example but, for now, I am more interested in its abstract structure. A structure that I imperfectly described, unfortunately. I did not mean to describe a case where distinct reflectance types are co-realized by a determinate reflectance. Rather, the case is meant to be one where the perceivers select the same reflectance type to be a color in distinct families of color properties. The former type of case is, I believe, not only possible, but probably actual. (Forget about my views about intraspecies variation, think of interspecies variation. Something might be visible to bees and humans partly by virtue of their tracking distinct reflectance types co-instantiated by that thing.) The latter type of case is improbable, but seems at least logically possible given selectionism.

Maybe it isn't in fact logically possible, but I know of no grounds for claiming this.

However, if cases with that structure are logically possible then there are some problems. Here are two that arise on the assmption that colors are reflectance types.

First, in the paper we co-wrote, one important claim was that colors could be individuated in terms of color similarity relations. But that's not consistent with two perceivers seeing the same color and selecting different color similarity relations that obtain between it and other colors.

Second, it seems to be a case where two perceivers see the same color and yet their perceptions differ in phenomenal character.

Neither consequence I find palatable.

The relationalist has a response. If colors are relational qualities partly determined by an object's reflectance type these problems do not arise. Selected color similarities will pick out distinct perceiver relative qualities so there is no objection to the individuation thesis; and since the perceivers are seeing distinct relational qualities, there is no obstacle to their manifest nature explaining the distinct phenomenal qualities of the respective experiences. (The relationalist, in effect, reduces the latter type of case to the former type.)

But I abhore relationalism.

That's partly why I was experimentally leaving it open that colors might be light affecting qualities of material objects realized by if not identified with a disjunction of determinate reflectances. Just leaving myself some wriggle room for metaphysical speculation.

Let me comment on one thing you mention. 'Multiple constitution' sounds odd, to be sure, but multiple realization is familiar and intelligible and captures the intended idea I think. Notice that the causal problem you allude to might arise for the physicalist as well. It might seem that what does the causal work is the determinate reflectance instantiated by the perceived object and not the disjunctive property.

But at any rate, I am not overly impressed with the temptation to suppose that all the causal work is being done by lower level properties. The causal explanation in terms of the determinable seem to be more informative. Red things look red because they are red. The determinate reflectance instantiated by a perceived red thing cannot underwrite that causal explanatory claim. A number of people make similar points---Puntam, Broackes, Yablo, even Campbell I think. But I am just beginning to think about chromatic causation.

I would be very interested to see what you come up with about color blindness. Let me know if you make any progress.

Thanks very much for writing back. Hope all is well in Chicago.

All the best, Mark
